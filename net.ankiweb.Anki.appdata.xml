  <description>
    <p>Anki is a program which makes remembering things easy. Because it's a lot more efficient than traditional study methods, you can either greatly decrease your time spent studying, or greatly increase the amount you learn.</p>
    <p>Anyone who needs to remember things in their daily life can benefit from Anki. Since it is content-agnostic and supports images, audio, videos and scientific markup (via LaTeX), the possibilities are endless.</p>
    <p>Optional LaTeX support is provided by the TeX Live Flatpak extension org.freedesktop.Sdk.Extension.texlive//21.08.</p>

      <description>
        <ul>
          <li>Fix a bug in Anki 2.1.28+ where a newly created deck config would default to an ease of 130%. When updating, Anki will automatically change any deck configs with an ease of 130% back to 250%, and change any cards using those deck configs with a low ease back to an ease of 250%. (cont.)</li>
          <li>(cont.) Users who updated from an older Anki version and did not add new deck configurations should not be affected. If you have deliberately set an initial ease of 130%, please change it to 131% or greater prior to upgrading, so that Anki leaves your settings alone. Thanks to Aleksa for discovering the issue.</li>
          <li>Update the standard builds to the latest GUI toolkit version. Please report any improvements or regressions you notice.</li>
          <li>Dropped audio plays automatically again (thanks to abdo).</li>
